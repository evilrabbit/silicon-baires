// The city: load the glb, collapse it into instanced meshes, and move the
// 1784 things that move.
//
// WHY THE COLLAPSE. The glb has 8131 nodes over 172 meshes, because that is
// what the .blend has: every car in the city is a separate object sharing one
// mesh datablock, which is the cheapest instancing Blender offers. Added to a
// three.js scene as-is that is 8131 draw calls and the page runs at about 12
// fps on an M4. Grouped by (geometry, material) it is a couple of hundred
// InstancedMesh, and the same frame costs nothing.
//
// NOTHING HERE KNOWS WHAT A CITY IS. It groups by geometry and moves whatever
// city_motion.json names. Rebuild the .blend differently and this file does
// not change.
