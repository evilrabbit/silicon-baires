Each file is the best format that exists publicly, looked for in this order: SVG
from the official site → SVG from Wikimedia Commons → the highest-resolution PNG
there is.

**This table is the inventory, not a changelog.** Every file in this directory
gets a row, and a file with no row is a gap in the table rather than a file that
does not count. Git already records when each one arrived, so they are listed
alphabetically instead — the question anyone brings here is "is there a vector
for X, and what does it lack", never "what shipped in August".

**Normalise an SVG before saving it**: explicit `width`/`height` taken from the
`viewBox`. Blender's importer does not understand `width="100%"` and returns an
empty curve without saying so.

**`_iso` and `_word` are one lockup split into two files.** `_brands.HERO` mounts
the symbol and the wordmark in different places — the symbol on a wall, the name
laid flat on a roof — so they have to be separate curves. The pairs below share
their parent's `viewBox`, which is what makes them a split rather than two
downloads.

## Vector (57 files)

| file | brand | source |
|---|---|---|
| `aerolab.svg` | Aerolab | inline SVG from the aerolab.co header |
| `aleph.svg` | Aleph | inline SVG from alephholding.com |
| `auth0.svg` | Auth0 | worldvectorlogo. Shield symbol, no wordmark |
| `auth0_iso.svg` | Auth0 | split of the lockup — source not recorded |
| `auth0_word.svg` | Auth0 | split of the lockup — source not recorded |
| `basement.svg` | Basement | inline SVG from basement.studio |
| `bioceres.svg` | Bioceres Crop Solutions | **traced, not downloaded.** This company publishes no SVG anywhere: biocerescrops.com and its Q4 investor site are both behind Cloudflare, Commons has nothing, and the only public mark is a 350x70 PNG at `s26.q4cdn.com/783252186/files/design/logo.png`. That PNG was composited on white, upscaled 5x, thresholded and run through `potrace`, then filled with `#004676` sampled off the original. The full lockup — symbol, name, and "CROP SOLUTIONS" on a second line. **Unused**: see `bioceres_word.svg` |
| `bioceres_iso.svg` | Bioceres Crop Solutions | the trefoil alone, traced from the left 88 px of the same PNG. Unused today; it is the format a roof would want |
| `bioceres_word.svg` | Bioceres Crop Solutions | the name alone, traced from a 262x44 crop of the same PNG, 6:1. The full lockup was tried first and rendered as a blue smudge: on 7.8 m of wall the second line is 30 cm of serif text. **Unused since the brand moved to spot 155**: see the `_light` file below |
| `bioceres_word_light.svg` | Bioceres Crop Solutions | the same trace with the `#004676` fill swapped for white, and **this is the one `_brands` uses.** Not a taste call: the wall on spot 155 is 64 % `Glass Dark` #15181b across the band the logo occupies, where the navy is 1.5:1 and white is 12:1. White is also what the brand itself uses on dark ground. Four brands in this list are white on warm concrete with no such answer available |
| `belo.svg` | Belo | inline SVG from belo.app. The `fill` arrived as `var(--token-…, rgb(83,0,218))` and was replaced with `#5300da`: Blender does not resolve CSS variables and imported it black |
| `brubank.svg` | Brubank | Webflow CDN, the footer logo of brubank.com, 135x28. Wordmark only, 4.8:1 — this brand has no separate symbol. The header file at the same CDN is the SAME lockup with 35 % of empty viewBox on its right, which would have sized the wall off dead space; both were rasterised and compared before choosing. The four bounding-box `mask` elements and the `clipPath` went out, for the reason recorded under `cocos.svg` |
| `coderhouse.svg` | Coderhouse | Framer CDN, coderhouse.com, 811x236. Wordmark only, 8.4:1 |
| `cocos.svg` | Cocos Capital | inline SVG from cocos.capital, 192x86, via a web.archive.org capture: the live site is behind Cloudflare and answers 403 to everything that is not a browser. The stacked lockup — the symbol over the wordmark — with the `clipPath` dropped, because Blender imports the clip rectangle as a curve and it would set the bounds |
| `cocos_iso.svg` | Cocos Capital | split of `cocos.svg` — the two arcs, navy `#002C65` and blue `#0062E1` |
| `cocos_word.svg` | Cocos Capital | split of `cocos.svg` — the five letters, 5:1. **This is the one `_brands` uses**: the lockup is 2.2:1 and its wall is bound by the height |
| `complif.svg` | Complif | Webflow CDN, complif.com, 690x189. **White**: needs a dark facade |
| `complif_dark.svg` | Complif | the same file with the `fill` at `#1c1c1c`, for when the brand moves to a light wall. Unused today: the facade it landed on is dark brick |
| `decentraland.svg` | Decentraland | inline SVG from the decentraland.org header, 90x90. The three `linearGradient` fills were flattened to solid colours — `#FF6A55` for the disc, `#D22884` for the two peaks — because Blender resolves no gradient and imports the paths black. **The icon is the whole logo**: this brand publishes no wordmark in vector form, on its own site or anywhere else |
| `despegar.svg` | Despegar | Wikimedia Commons |
| `digitalhouse.svg` | Digital House | Prismic CDN, digitalhouse.com |
| `etermax_new.svg` | Etermax | **source not recorded**. 38x43, the symbol rather than the wordmark |
| `etermax_word.svg` | Etermax | **source not recorded**. 7470x4754. This is the one `_brands` uses |
| `galicia_iso.svg` | Galicia | **the symbol alone**, from the Paisanos site, who did work for them. It is the current brand (orange circle, white dagger). The new lowercase wordmark is NOT public in vector form: Commons, logotyp.us and seeklogo all carry the previous one, the orange box with "Galicia" in serif |
| `globant.svg` | Globant | Wikimedia Commons, 2999x520 |
| `humand.svg` | Humand | **source not recorded**. 139x23, wordmark |
| `increase.svg` | Increase | inline SVG from increasecard.com |
| `lemon.svg` | Lemon | inline SVG from lemon.me |
| `lemon_iso.svg` | Lemon | split of `lemon.svg` — same 274x63 viewBox |
| `lemon_word.svg` | Lemon | split of `lemon.svg` — same 274x63 viewBox |
| `maslow.svg` | Maslow | inline SVG from maslow.hr, 116x32. Symbol in three brand colours, wordmark in **white** — this is the only version the company publishes. **Unused since the brand moved to spot 172**: see the `_dark` file below |
| `maslow_dark.svg` | Maslow | the same file with the white at `#111827`, and **this is the one `_brands` uses.** The wall on spot 172 is `Glass Light` #5f97a6, where white is 3.1:1 and the near-black is 7:1 — the first of these facades bright enough for the dark variant to be the right way round |
| `mercadolibre.svg` | Mercado Libre | Commons, Spanish wordmark. **No handshake** |
| `ml_iso.svg` | Mercado Libre | the handshake `mercadolibre.svg` lacks — **source not recorded** |
| `mp_iso.svg` | Mercado Pago | **source not recorded**. 64x64, the light-blue handshake |
| `mural.svg` | Mural | Webflow CDN, the header logo of mural.co, 620x178, 3.5:1. **Replaces the Commons 2022 version that used to be here**, which carried a white background box the note at the bottom of this file was written about — that box is why nothing ever mounted it. The live file has none. Its `clipPath` went out for the reason recorded under `cocos.svg`, and one `fill="white"` path was dropped: rasterised before and after, it changes nothing |
| `openzeppelin.svg` | OpenZeppelin | inline SVG from the openzeppelin.com header, 161x24, with the lowercase `viewbox` corrected — Blender's importer wants `viewBox` and returns an empty curve without it. The wordmark's `#0a0a0a` was turned **white**: the wall it hangs on is dark blue glass and the near-black lockup vanished into it. The shield keeps its three blues |
| `openzeppelin_dark.svg` | OpenZeppelin | the site's own file, wordmark still near-black, for a pale wall |
| `naranjax.svg` | Naranja X | Wikimedia Commons. Split by colour at runtime, not into files: the nine orange strokes are the word, the two violet ones the X |
| `paisanos.svg` | Paisanos | inline SVG from paisanos.io. White wordmark plus lime symbol: needs a dark background |
| `pomelo.svg` | Pomelo | inline SVG from pomelo.la |
| `preguntados.svg` | Preguntados (etermax) | **source not recorded**. 1788x1788. Laid flat on the Etermax roof: it is what that company puts on a building ahead of its own name |
| `rebill.svg` | Rebill | inline SVG from rebill.com. Arrives as `currentColor`, i.e. with no colour: the table's `ink` wins |
| `revamos.svg` | Revamos | supplied by the client, the full lockup, 7.9:1. Arrived as `fill="currentColor"` with the colours in the page's `text-white` / `text-turquoise` classes; both **inlined** as `#ffffff` and `#00d9bd`, because Blender resolves neither `currentColor` nor a `<style>` block — and for the `<style>` form it does not import colourless, it imports **black**, which beats the brand's `ink`. `width`/`height` added from the `viewBox`. **White wordmark**: mounted against the glazing band on spot 75 rather than on the spandrel, see `_brands.HERO` |
| `revamos_plate.svg` | Revamos | **not a logo**: the black backing plate the Revamos sign sits on, 6.41:1. Drawn here, not sourced. It is a separate file rather than a rectangle inside `revamos.svg` because `logo()` extrudes one artwork's pieces to a single depth — see the note in the file |
| `satellogic.svg` | Satellogic | satellogic.com WordPress |
| `sla.svg` | SLA | Official SVG from https://slatv.live/sla-logo.svg; 2469x742 viewBox, light mark for the dedicated dark facade |
| `takenos_iso.svg` | Takenos | split of the lockup — source not recorded |
| `takenos_word.svg` | Takenos | split of the lockup — source not recorded |
| `technisys.svg` | Technisys | web.archive.org, 2021 capture. The brand no longer exists: SoFi absorbed it |
| `tiendanube.svg` | Tiendanube | inline SVG from tiendanube.com |
| `tiendanube_iso.svg` | Tiendanube | split of `tiendanube.svg` — the two clouds |
| `tiendanube_word.svg` | Tiendanube | split of `tiendanube.svg` — the wordmark |
| `uala.svg` | Ualá | Wikimedia Commons |
| `uala2.svg` | Ualá | **source not recorded**. 1820x420. This is the one `_brands` uses |
| `vercel.svg` | Vercel | worldvectorlogo |
| `vercel_iso.svg` | Vercel | the triangle alone, 24x24 — source not recorded |

## Raster (5 files)

| file | brand | source and size |
|---|---|---|
| `etermax.png` | Etermax | Commons, 3735x2377 |
| `modo.png` | MODO | Storyblok CDN, modo.com.ar, 436x96. **The smallest of the lot** |
| `olx.png` | OLX | Commons, 1000x1000 |
| `ripio.png` | Ripio | Commons, 5000x2292 |
| `uala_iso.png` | Ualá | Commons, 4501x4501 combination mark |

`_contact.png` is the contact sheet, for looking at them together. It is not a
logo and has no row above.

## What has to be sorted out

**Sixteen files had no provenance at all**, and twelve of them are mounted by
`_brands.HERO` today. They are marked "source not recorded" above rather than
left out, because a table that silently covers two thirds of a directory reads
as complete. Filling them in means finding where each came from; until then the
gap is at least visible.

**Four are white**: `aerolab`, `aleph`, `digitalhouse` and `pomelo` come from
dark-background sites and disappear on a light facade. Either the dark variant
gets sourced, or the sign carrying them has to be dark by design decision.

**`modo.png` is 436x96** and raster. On a 34 m party wall it does not hold up.
If MODO goes on a large format, the vector has to be found.

**The roofmarks and the masts want a symbol, not a wordmark.** Most of these
files are the full horizontal lockup, which read from 250 m up is an illegible
line of text. The `_iso` splits above are that problem being worked through one
brand at a time; the ones without a split still want one.
