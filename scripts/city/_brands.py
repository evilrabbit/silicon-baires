"""The real brands, one table, and the order is the priority.

`assign_brands()` in 04 hands out the names by visibility: it ranks the signs
by `shot_cover` and gives the most visible one the first unused entry. So the
ORDER OF THESE LISTS IS THE ORDER THE CAMERA FINDS THEM IN. The brands with an
SVG come first because they are the ones built in 3D, extruded from the real
curve; the ones that only exist as a bitmap come after, with a generic symbol;
and the invented ones go last, which is where the camera no longer reaches.

The table does not have to be any particular length. `DRAW_WIDTH` in 04 is
pinned for a different reason (the draw during placement consumes RNG and moves
buildings), and the brand that draw picks is a placeholder this table overwrites
wholesale at the end of the run.

`svg` is the file under `assets/logos/`. If it is None the brand falls back to
the geometric symbol in `mark`, which is the system the city was built with.
See `assets/logos/SOURCES.md` for where each file came from and what it lacks.

`face` is the colour of the sign and `ink` the colour of the logo. `ink` is only
used when the SVG is monochrome or declares no colour: when the file carries its
own palette (Globant is two colours, Pomelo is six) the file wins, because the
colour is part of the brand and not a decision this city gets to make.


## Adding a brand, in five steps

    ./bl scripts/city/90_brand_sites.py

reports the free buildings with the wall to use, how much of that wall the
camera sees, how far the kerb is and what size fits. Then:

  1. The SVG into `assets/logos/`, with explicit `width`/`height` taken from the
     `viewBox` — Blender's importer does not understand `width="100%"` and
     returns an empty curve without saying so. Record the source in
     `SOURCES.md`.
  2. The brand into `CAMPUS` (B2B) or `AVENUE` (consumer), with its colour.
  3. The building into `EXTRA`, with the coordinate 90 reported. It is an
     ANCHOR: nothing is built from it, it exists so the manifest has a record to
     pin the brand to.
  4. The wall into `HERO`, with `facade_only` and the `facade_side` 90 reported.
     A wordmark is bound by the width of the wall, a symbol by its height, and
     the ground floor is set back: the logo lives between about 5 m and the
     parapet.
  5. `./bl scripts/city/04_buildings.py && ./bl scripts/city/10_signs.py`, and
     LOOK AT THE RENDER. Then the whole chain from 06, and 93 for the number.

What NOT to re-derive — each one of these cost a render:

  · A logo goes on the FRONT, not on the roof. A roofmark at 250 m is a pale
    rectangle; a wall is 28 m of letters.
  · "The longest face" is almost always the one inside the complex.
  · A wall can face the street and still be hidden, by the other arm of its own
    L or by the neighbour a metre away. That is a sightline question.
  · One brand per address, and the address is the CELL, not the wing. The
    exceptions are declared in `SHARED` with their reason.

    #   east wing face   y -64.95 .. -46.17   centred on -55.56
    #   half-run north    9.39 m   <- this is the binding one
    #   half-run south    9.39 m of its own wing, then the south wing carries on
    #                     to -74.79, but centring cannot reach it
    #
    # 2 x 9.39 = 18.78 m of usable wall. `run` in hero_facade is the PADDED box,
    # 19.68, so 0.945 of it lands the mark at 18.6 m — 9 cm of air at each end.
    # Bigger than that and the north end leaves the building: at 24.6 m it hung
    # 2.91 m into open air, which is what a previous pass shipped.

    # WHY THE WHOLE LOCKUP AND NOT THE SYMBOL. This wall is the one that makes
    # it possible. The short +Y wall of the same wing is 9.09 m, and 7.9:1 of
    # artwork on 9 m gives a 1.04 m cap height. On 18.6 it is 2.36 m.
    #
    # THE COST IS THE STREET, AND IT IS NOT A COURTYARD. This building is a U
    # and it does have an internal court — 9.09 x 18.78 m between the two
    # vertical wings, opening north — but the sign is not on it. It is on the
    # OUTER face of the east wing, at x -100.1, looking east across open lawn.
    # `wall_to_street` reports 31.3 m for it because the nearest kerb on that

    # ---- the five that came in when the corridor was already full ----------
    #
    # THE CITY HAD THREE FREE WALLS AND FIVE BRANDS TO PLACE, and the two extra
    # ones did not come from relaxing anything. They came from two questions 90
    # does not ask:
    #
    #   · a sign carrying an INVENTED name is not a client. Taking one over
    #     removes a made-up roofmark and adds a real logo, which is the trade
    #     the video wants. Maslow took Pampa's and Mural took Ombú's.
    #   · a building with two arms has two walls on two different PLANES. That
    #     is the Ualá / Brubank arrangement, and it is declared in SHARED.
    #     Mural and Bioceres share the U at (33.75, -231.25).
    #
    # Every one of the five is `facade_only`: a logo hung high on the front,
    # nothing built on the deck.
    #
    # THE WALL WAS READ BEFORE THE BRAND WAS ASSIGNED. A ray fired at each of
    # the five reports the material band by band, and they are not alike:
    #
    #   (-84.2, -89.8)   Concrete Cool2  #8d9599   cornices every 7.6 m
    #   ( 66.2,-231.2)   Brick Warm      #a86a4c   4.6 m to 23.8, unbroken
    #   ( 66.2,-260.4)   Facade Teal     #2f7f74   banded with Glass Light
    #   ( 44.0,-227.5)   Concrete Cool2  #8d9599   plain to 12.2 m
    #   ( 23.5,-227.5)   Concrete Cool2  #8d9599   the other arm of the same U
    #
    # so the two dark logos went to grey walls, the white one to the teal wall,
    # and the coral symbol to the brick. SOURCES.md lists four brands that are
    # white on warm concrete with no answer; this batch does not add a fifth.
    #
    # The tallest wall in the free set (32 m) and the widest (21.3 m), which is
    # what a 6.7:1 lockup needs: the width binds and `facade_tall` is only there
    # to stop the height taking over. It sits in the band between the cornices
    # at 23.4 and 31.0 m — those stand 0.45 m proud of the wall and a logo
    # crossing one comes out sliced, which is the Coderhouse lesson.

    # THE RIGHT FACE OF SPOT 107, the 32 m tower at (33.75, -254.75), asked
    # for. Only one of its two faces is usable at all: the left one is `seen`
    # 0.00, hidden whole by the block in front of it.
    #
    # AND ON A TOWER THE HEIGHT IS THE WHOLE DECISION, because visibility and
    # framing pull opposite ways. Measured up this wall:
    #
    #     z      seen    in frame
    #     6–9    0.00    6–7 s      the base is behind the neighbour
    #     11     0.52    5.7 s

    #     26+    1.00    0.0 s      seen whole, and the move never frames it
    #
    # So the best band of wall on this building — 7.5 m of clean concrete from
    # 4.8 to 12.2, enough for a logo twice this size — is the one nothing can
    # see, and the part that is seen whole is above the top of the shot. 19 m
    # is where the two curves cross.
    #
    # It crosses floor lines on purpose: every band between 16 and 22 is teal
    # or pale glass, so a black-and-primary wordmark reads across all of them.
    # That is the opposite of the Bioceres call one entry down, and the reason
    # is the ink, not the wall.

    # THE LEFT FACE OF SPOT 155, the east arm of the C at (211.0, -303.4), and
    # asked for. It is the same wall on paper as its neighbour at (192.5,
    # -303.4) — 38.4 m of run, seen whole — and the difference is the only one
    # that matters here: this one has the kerb 2.9 m away and that one has it
    # 21.4, because it faces into the complex.
    #
    # THE WHITE FILE, AND A MATERIAL IS A DISTRIBUTION. One ray at the centre
    # of this face answers `Concrete Cool2`, #8d9599, and on that the navy is a
    # comfortable 3.4:1 — so the navy went up, and the render showed it on
    # near-black glass. The single ray had hit a MULLION. Sampled across the
    # run at the band the logo occupies, 8.8–11.5 m, the wall is 64 % `Glass
    # Dark` #15181b and 36 % concrete: navy on it is 1.5:1. White is 12:1, and
    # is what the brand uses on dark ground.
    #
    # AND THEN IT HAS TO SIT IN ONE BAND. White reads on the glass and vanishes
    # on the slab, so a logo spanning both loses the letters that fall on the
    # pale part — the first three, in the render that caught it. This wall has
    # two clean glass runs, 5.75–8.35 and 9.75–12.15, and the sign is sized to
    # fit inside the upper one rather than centred on the wall and left to
    # cross a floor line. That costs about 3 m of width and it is worth it.
    #
    # THE WORDMARK ALONE, NOT THE LOCKUP, and it is the same call Cocos made
    # for a different reason. The full lockup sets "CROP SOLUTIONS" on a second
    # line under the name: at this size that line is a few centimetres of serif
    # text and the whole thing renders as a blue smudge. The name alone is 6:1,
    # so the width binds.
