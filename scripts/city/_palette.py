"""Every colour in the city, once.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The palette used to live in four places at the same time
and the last one to run won:

    00_setup.PALETTE      19 materials, created at build time
    03_ground.retint()    17 of them overwritten, and this is the one that won
    06_landmarks.repaint()  a few more overwritten again
    pbrmat("X", "#hex")   scattered through 02b, 03, 04, 06b, 10

`retint` and `repaint` are the same six lines written twice, and both carry the
same comment explaining that they had to exist because `pbrmat` fetches an
existing material by name and returns it UNTOUCHED - so once a colour is saved
in city.blend with a fake user, editing the hex in the script does nothing at
all and raises nothing at all. Two rebuilds were lost to that, once for the bus
shelters and once for the stadium facade.

So: one table, one value per material, and it always wins over what is already
in the .blend. The values below were read back out of the .blend rather than
copied from the scripts, so they are what the city actually renders, not what
the scripts hoped it rendered. Where the two disagreed, the .blend was right:
STYLE-BIBLE.md still lists asphalt as #3a3a3c and it has been #211e19 since
step 03 darkened the roads to put some black back in the frame.

WHAT IS NOT HERE. The company signs. Steps 04 and 10 invent one `Logo <brand>`
and one `Ink <brand>` per company, and the avenue formats (billboards and
medianeras) get a private pair per sign - `Logo Sign.045 BOCA` - on purpose, so
that dropping real artwork on one wall does not repaint four others. Those are
generated, not art-directed, and they stay with `pbrmat()`.
