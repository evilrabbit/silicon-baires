"""Step 04 — buildings: massing, facades, roofs.

Every building is a stack of floors. A floor is a solid spandrel band with a
recessed glass band above it and thin mullions across the glass, which is the
pattern the reference repeats everywhere. Four facade styles cover the whole
city; footprints are rectangles combined into L, U, T and bar shapes.

Roof props come from the KIT as instances, because they repeat constantly.

# --- the signs are for the camera, and the camera goes one way -------------
# This file used to plan signs evenly over the whole city, which sounds neutral
# and is not: the shot crosses a 700 m city on one 320 m diagonal, so an even
# spread put 59 of 77 signs where the film never looks. Measured, not guessed -
# 93_check_signs.py is the instrument and it reported 18 in frame and twelve
# distinct brands.
#
# Three rules now, and all three are enforced rather than hoped for:
#
#   IN THE SHOT       a roof the camera passes over is worth a sign; one it
#                     does not pass over is scenery. CORRIDOR_FILL is the extra
#                     chance a building in the strip gets one anyway.
#   ONE PER BUILDING  two brands on one address reads as one company with two
#                     logos.
#   NOT STUCK TOGETHER  two signs landing on the same corner of the frame read
#                     as one busy patch. MIN_GAP is how far apart they stay.
#
# The last two are enforced in the SECOND PASS, at the bottom of this file, and
# that is deliberate: dropping a sign after every building is published costs
# the shared RNG nothing, so the city itself comes out identical to the run
# before. Enforcing them during placement would have reshuffled all eighty lots
# and changed a frame that was already approved, to fix a problem that has
# nothing to do with where the buildings are.
IN_SHOT_SECS = 1.0        # in frame this long to count as being in the shot
CORRIDOR_FILL = 1.00      # extra chance of a sign on a roof the shot crosses

# HOW WIDE THE BRAND TABLES WERE WHEN THE CITY WAS APPROVED, and the strangest
# looking pair of numbers in this file. They are pinned because the brand drawn
# during placement is a PLACEHOLDER - assign_brands() overwrites every one of
# them at the end of the run - but the DRAW still has to cost the random
# generator exactly what it used to.
#
# random.choice() does not consume a fixed amount of the stream. It calls
# _randbelow(n), which pulls n.bit_length() bits and rejects out-of-range
# values, so a 30-name list takes five bits a draw where a 14-name list takes
# four. Widening the tables therefore reshuffled every building placed after
# every sign in the city: the buildings mesh went from 258704 vertices to
# 257868, entirely invisibly, because nothing about a longer list of company
# names looks like it could move a building.
#
# Found by hashing the mesh against the previous .blend, which is the only way
# it could have been found. It renders perfectly either way.

#
