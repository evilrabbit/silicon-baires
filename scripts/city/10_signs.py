"""Step 10 — company signs, ready for logos.

The reference is a parade of real logos. We are reproducing the city, not the
branding, so these carry invented companies; what is being reproduced is how a
logo is physically mounted on a building, which is the part that has to be
built now if it is ever going to be swapped for artwork later.

Three mountings, all read off the reference frames:

  parapet   individual extruded letters mounted on the facade wall, hanging
            just under the roof edge and projecting out from it. This is the
            Google one. Note where they are: NOT standing on top of the
            parapet, which is how this was built first. In the reference the
            letters sit on the wall with the roof-edge band running above them
            and they cast their shadow down the facade, which is where all
            their contrast comes from - pale wall behind saturated letter.
            Standing them on the parapet puts them against the sky and the
            roof, and they lose it.
  roofmark  a flat panel lying on the deck with a mark on it, costing no
            height at all. The orange square with the white B.
  mast      a large disc on a pole, standing clear of everything and turned to
            face the camera. One or two in frame, no more: it is a hero.

And two more that belong to 9 de Julio and to nowhere else in this city. The
real avenue is an advertising corridor and the two formats that make it one are
the rooftop billboard and the painted medianera:

  billboard a large panel standing on a visible steel frame on a roof, floating
            about 4 m over the deck on legs, with a catwalk under it. Turned to
            face the camera rather than to face the avenue, which is what the
            real ones do too: they are aimed at the traffic, and here the
            traffic is the lens.
  medianera a mural on a blind party wall, hung from just under the parapet.
            Its size is not a range in this file: art. 5.4.b of Ley 2936 lets
            it cover half the wall it is on and caps nothing in square metres,
            so step 04 measures it against that wall and these come out from
            13 m to nearly 40 m wide. One flat panel and one mark, no letters:
            the artwork is a texture that goes on later.

The two avenue formats get their own material per sign rather than one shared
per brand, because dropping a real mural onto one wall must not repaint every
other wall carrying the same invented company.

Step 04 chooses where they go and reserves the space, and writes the plan to
city_signs.json. This step only builds. That split is not tidiness: the roof
units are placed in step 04, and until it knew about the signs it put nine of
them inside one.

Each sign is its own object with its own material slots, so dropping real
artwork on one later is a material swap on a named object, not a rebuild.

    mark() draws in, so a logo drops into every mounting the geometric marks
    already had. The caller scales height and thickness separately, because
    they are not the same kind of number: how tall a sign is depends on the
    building, and how deep it is is a fact about built letters. Tying the two
    together drove AUTH0's shield — 6 m tall because it is nearly square —
    1.3 m into its own facade, and 99_check_overlap caught it.

    A logo is not a texture here. Blender reads the SVG as curves and extrudes
    them, so the letterforms get the same relief the parapet letters have and
    the same shadow down the facade, which is where those get their contrast.
    That also means no UVs, no image nodes, and nothing for the glTF exporter
    to lose on the way to the browser.

    The colour comes from the file when the file has one. A logo that arrives
    as a single flat colour (or none at all, which is what `currentColor` in a
    website's inline SVG turns into) gets the sign's own ink instead.

    # after it, and leaves it behind: 20 logos x a run added ~29 of them each
    # time, so the .blend had hundreds of empty `pomelo.svg.014` collections
    # that nobody sees in a render and that the glTF exporter faithfully
    # writes out as nodes. They are removed by name because that name is the
    # importer's, not ours: nothing else in this city is called *.svg.
