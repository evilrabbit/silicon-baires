"""Step 06 — landmarks.

The pieces that break the grid and give the frame something to hang on: a
stadium, a curved organic building, an open-deck parking structure and a
construction site with lattice cranes. Everything else in the city is a box on
a lot; these are the exceptions, and the reference leans on them hard.

# El Monumental, at this city's scale, which is about a quarter of life size -
# the blocks are 76 m where a real one is 110, and the stadium has to fit a
# block. So these are not the real stadium's metres, they are its proportions.
#
# The first version was a smooth white drum with a lawn in the hole, and it read
# as "a stadium" and nothing more. The second added a track and a notch and read
# as "a stadium with a track". What was still wrong is the thing a photograph of
# the ground makes obvious in a second: from outside you SEE THE BOWL. The
# facade is low and the white-and-red rake stands above it. The old code ran the
# outer wall from the ground to the top of the stands, which is a drum with a
# lawn in it however good the lawn is.
#
# Four things carry which ground it is, in the order they survive being 80 px
# wide:
#
#   1. THE SEATS: white with big red chevrons. Every photograph of this place,
#      from 1978 to last week, is white and red zig-zags. It is the only cue
#      that is a colour break the size of the whole building, so it is the one
#      that reads first, and it is the one the model did not have at all.
#   2. THE FACADE IS LOWER THAN THE STANDS, mid-grey concrete banded with
#      advertising, with the white rake and the roof rim rising over it. This is
#      the whole silhouette. Under 40 px it is all that is left.
#   3. A RING THAT IS NOT UNIFORM. The ground was a horseshoe until the
#      Centenario stand closed it for 1978, and the ends have stayed lower.
#      The dip is on the +x side, so the camera, which looks along -x, still
#      sees down into the bowl.
#   4. AN OVAL RATHER THAN A CIRCLE, roofed the whole way round, with the
#      scoreboard slung between two red columns over the far end.
#
# NOTE ON WHICH MONUMENTAL. This is the ground AS IT IS NOW: the 2023-24
# remodelling lowered the pitch, rebuilt the lower ring and took the athletics
# track out. TRACK below puts it back for the configuration this place had for
# most of its life - the rest of the geometry is shared, since the remodelling
# rebuilt the inside of the bowl and left the drum around it alone.
#
# THE WHOLE THING HAS TO FIT ITS LOT, which is 59 m inside a 64 m block. An
# early rebuild forgot that: deeper stands and stair towers took the outside
# radius from 27.2 to 30.6, which with the 1.30 oval is 79 m across - fifteen
# metres wider than the block. It overhung the pavement on both sides and
# 99_check_overlap found five trees and people standing inside it. Every radius
# here is therefore left exactly where it was; this rebuild changes what fills
# them and how tall each piece is, and not how much ground the stadium takes.
